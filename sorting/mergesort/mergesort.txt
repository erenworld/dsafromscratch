Merge sort is a sorting algorithm.
- its a divide and conquer algorithm
- its works recursively by breaking down a problem into sub-problems
- then solves sub-problems and combine them
- it returns a sorted array

Divide: Divide the list or array recursively into two halves until it can no more be divided.
Conquer: Each subarray is sorted individually using the merge sort algorithm.
Merge: The sorted subarrays are merged back together in sorted order. 
       The process continues until all elements from both subarrays have been merged.


Real world examples: 
- sorting large datasets



Let's sort this array together !

[38, 27, 43, 10]
38 27      43 10
38   27    43    10
// merge
27 38      10 43
// merge
10 27 38 43
